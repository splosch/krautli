# krautli_yo#

`Krautli` is supposed to become an app that allows users to log positions of their favorite plants and find them back at times certain of their plantparts become harvestable.
It started offline as a collection of notes and photos taken with a smartphone - so the photos contain the geoposition of the photo taken - to loate the found plant later on.

Since thats pretty tideous - the idea of `Krautli` was born.


## Technical Note ##

The app will be a SPA(Single-Page-Application) that is running in a browser or a native wrapper for Android or iOS devices. Anyhow it should always work with a recent browser on every device.

### The Techstack behind: ###
- Angular JS for the frontend framework
- git as versioning / repository
- twitter bootstrap as UI Library providing interaction and visual patterns
- yeoman / grunt / bower
 - provide the development frameing
 - prototyoing setup
 - unit / integration testing 
- other dependencies
 - angularLocalStorage installed via bower https://github.com/agrublev/angularLocalStorage
