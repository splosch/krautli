# Design notes for 'Krautli' #

'Krautli' is in two ways a SPA
1. "Single Page Application" which covers the technical aspect
2. "Single Purpose Application" which covers the usecase of loging and recovery of stored plant - positions

Design keys
- single purpose
-- one thing at a time (One primary action per page / max 2?? secondaries)
-- no poweruser support (responsible harvesting!)
- simple & effective
-- easy to read (contrast, size, amount)
-- all offine (as a package)
-- no fancy schmancy (subtle animation, no shadow)
- natural
-- natural tones (green brown orange, all desaturized)

1. Pick the color scheme [anthrazit, spacegray, lightgrey, mossygreen, sanddornorange, vogelbeerred]
2. Name two reference designs the guide
3. Select Typografie & add examples
